    <h1>The <span>Golden Astronaut</span> is an artist!</h1>
    <p>ðŸ§¡ Thank you for visiting my profile!</p>
    <p>ðŸ“Œ Hi! I am a computer science student who likes to sketch from time to time. I had a focus on traditional art but recently I got into digital as well so expect more of that too. :D</p>
    <p>ðŸŽ¨ My goal is to create believable worlds and characters that make you feel immersed and interested in their cosmos! I want to use my art to communicate these worlds to the viewer. To accomplish that I will try to start by studying from real life (photographs).</p>
    <p>ðŸŽ® In my free time I like to play games, watch anime, learn about history and make music among some other stuff.</p>
